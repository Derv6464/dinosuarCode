# dinosuarCode

This is python code for the adafruit feather m4 with neopixels.
it makes the neopixels look like eyes so they can be placed into a dinosuar costume head that I made.

It has a regular mode where it just shows eyes and when a button is pressed it go into "angry" mode where the neopixels turn red
